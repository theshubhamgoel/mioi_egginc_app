- A new player dashboard: Enter your Player ID to easily track your contracts
- A new farm value calculator with the ability to load one of your current farms
- The option to install this website as an app for your mobile device to enable easy access
- An optional dark theme

To gain access to a lot of the great features, ensure that you enter your Player ID on the Dashboard or Settings page. Your Player ID can be found at the bottom of the Privacy & Data menu in-game.

If you would like to access the old calculators, these are still available here: [contract](https://mioi.io/legacy/contract), [farm value](https://mioi.io/legacy/farmvalue).

I hope that you enjoy the new site and make sure to bookmark the new URL: *egginc.mioi.io*`
